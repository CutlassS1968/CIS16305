 * Q: How would you get rid of a cast statement in an array?
 *
 * ((Executive)staffList[0]).awardBonus(500.00);
 *
 * A: You could add the method to the parent class but that wouldn't make much sense
 *
 *
 *
 * Polymorphism is the ACTION of overriding, not making a class abstract IE: toString()
 *
 *
 *
 * Q: Pg. 421 You take out the toString() method in Employee, if you try to call toString for
 * hourly. What toString will it call?
 *
 * A:   T H E   L A S T   O V E R R I D D E N   P O I N T
 *
 *                    ... so hourly
 *
 *
 *
 * QUESTION: WHEN DECLARING A LAMBDA LISTENER FUNCTION FOR A BUTTON, IS THAT FUNCTION CALLED
 * EVERY TIME THE BUTTON IS PRESSED? IE DOES IT FUNCTION JUST LIKE A NORMAL ACTION PERFORMED CLASS?
